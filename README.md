# Beans - Angular PWA

This is an Angular Progressive Web App (PWA) version of the original Flutter beans app. The app helps users collect positive moments throughout their day as "beans" to focus on the good things in life.

## Features

- **Collect Beans**: Add positive moments with date and description
- **Bean Overview**: View collected beans with date filtering (last 2 weeks by default)
- **Statistics**: Charts showing beans collected per day/week/month
- **PWA Support**: Offline functionality, installable on mobile and desktop
- **Internationalization**: English and German language support
- **Material Design**: Clean, responsive UI with Angular Material

## Technology Stack

- Angular 17+ with PWA capabilities
- Angular Material for UI components
- TypeScript for type safety
- SCSS for styling
- Service Worker for offline support
- Local Storage for data persistence
