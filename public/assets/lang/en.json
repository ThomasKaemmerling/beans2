To Collect you push + button on the start screen and add a text with matter you collect this bean. You also see how many beans you have collected during the current day on startscreen. \r\n\r\nOn the overview page you can review the beans wich you have collected. Thats good to get an overview for the beans you have collected and wich positiv events you had in past. As standard you can see the last two weeks. You can also choose a time window you like to see from past.\r\n\r\nFurther more there are 3 Diagrams wich let you see the course of your collection. \r\n  1.) collection per day 14 days back\r\n  2.) collection per week 14 weeks back\r\n  3.) collection per month 12 month back \r\n\r\nTo collect the beans and remember the positiv things happen can be very helpful. Especialy if you have to go through hard times. Even if the times are hard and bad there are happen some maybe small but lucky moments and to remember them will help you to go through and see the world is not that bad at all. \r\n\r\nIt will help to get convidence and power to do your best to handel it.\r\n\r\nI wish you much fun with this app and amazing moments you can document.\r\n\r\nThomas K\u00E4mmerling",
